# A demo Laravel 9 NFT project

I needed an excuse to use a Laravel 9 Vite project that has event broadcasting via real-time updates through Laravel Echo with simple basic (custom) turn-based authentication. It simply flaunts Laravel Events broadcasting/Vite/Web Sockets/Payment Integration that you can spin-off! I also wanted to have a sample app that implements my [Laravel Multipay payments package](https://github.com/damms005/laravel-multipay).

So why not? 😜
